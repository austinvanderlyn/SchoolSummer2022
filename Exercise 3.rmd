### Exercise 3

#### 3.a

##### Start R and use these commands to load the data;

```{r}
library(caret)
data(tecator)
```

##### the matrix absorp contains the 100 absorbance values for the 215 samples, while matrix endpoints contains the percent of moisture, fat, and protein in columns 1-3, respectively


#### 3.b

##### Use PCA to determine the effective dimension of these data. What is the effective dimension?

Run PCA on absorb;
```{r}
PCA.ab = prcomp(absorp,
                center = TRUE,
                scale = TRUE)
```


To determine the principal components, calculate variance explained by each component;
```{r}
var = PCA.ab$sdev^2/sum(PCA.ab$sdev^2)*100
head(var)
```
